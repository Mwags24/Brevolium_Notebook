### Distance tree
![DistnceTree]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DistanceTree_noNA.pdf "Distance Tree")

**Figure 1**. Phylogenetic analysis of two populations of Brevolium From the Carribean. The populations are physically separated by a depth kline. Genetically they are separated by a distance of approximately .3 or 30% genetic variance.



### PCA

**Figure 2**. **(A)**Principal Component Analysis using PCA1 and PCA2. The two populations are segregated by PCA1. **(B)** The Eigenvalues showing the amount of variance described by each PCA. PCA1 describes most of the variance

### K3 Admixture

**Figure 3** An Admixture plot showing the K = 3 values. Assuming that there are three populations.


**FST value was 0.40116**
