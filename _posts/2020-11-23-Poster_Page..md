## The full poster

### Introduction

it is well documented that there are at least six genera of symbionts associated with coral.​
A study found evidence that suggested a population of the genus Brevolium differed genetically across a depth gradient​
Few studies have used transcriptome data to classify Symbiodincidae genuses ​
It is unknown what mechanisms are selected for between populations segregated by depth


### Methods

Transcriptome Data was taken from symbionts​
SNP data was used to run PCAs and Admixture​
Phylogenetic tree made using 28S genetic marker including each Symbiodincidae genus​
Go enrichment analysis of genes associated with Biological processes between the two populations​
​

### Distance tree

**Figure 1**. Phylogenetic analysis of two populations of Brevolium From the Carribean. The populations are physically separated by a depth kline. Genetically they are separated by a distance of approximately .3 or 30% genetic variance.



### PCA

### K3 Admixture

### Disscussion points

As Seen in the PCR graphs There is a very clear genetic difference between the two symbiont populations. Enough difference to classify the populations as different species (30%), could even be enough to consider them indifferent geneses.​
Transcriptome data was unused prior – allows for more acurate identification as well as identification of the genes under selection. Becoming more common in identification studies in other animals.​
Genes that encode for metabolism and photosynthesis were found to be under selection.​
Identifying and understanding the differences in symbionts can help better inform conservation efforts.​

# conclusion

* The Family of Simbiodinacidea is not yet fully taxinomically understood
* Two corals from the same species can have two different species of symbiont within them 



### further research

taxonomically identify the shallow species seen in this research, and use transcriptome data to identify more symbiont species, and use it to identify how they differ in mechanisms related to photosynthesis.​
