# What I have done over the past two weeks

After opservations on the past graphs and SNP counts I refiltered the vcf I was working with in order to keep more SNPS.

|**Filter**|**Code**|**Number of  SNPs**|
|Depth Filter| -min-meanDP 10 |kept 347031 out of a possible 1415812 Sites|
|Missing info | –max-missing 0.5 –minQ 30 | 48145 out of a possible 347031 Sites |
|Minor Allele frequency | –maf 0.01 | 30795 out of a possible 48145 Sites |
|Thinning | –thin 1000 | kept 7877 out of a possible 30795 Sites |
|Hardey Weinberg| perl filter_hwe_by_pop.pl | Kept 7043 of a possible 7877 loci |

The two samples that were labled as NA were also removed

## I created graphs using this newly filtered data set

### Distance Tree
![DistnceTree]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DistanceTree_noNA.pdf "Distance Tree")

### PCA
![PCA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/10x_PCA_noNA.pdf "PCA")

### Compoplot
![compoplot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Compoplot.pdf "compoplot")



# Bayescan

We then looked for SNPs under selection using Bayescan.
