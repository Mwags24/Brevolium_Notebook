# This post a list contains what I have been working on and need to finish


## With Genious (phylogenetic trees)

**Completed**

* a phylogenetic tree using the 28s ribosomal subunit 
    * including 4 samples from each the shallow and deep population, all of the type species for the Genuses, and all the Brevolium species.

**Need to Do**

* a tree containing psbA and/or ITS2

I ran into an issue with extracting the comp sequences containing psbA. The Bluewaves code that I had used before seemed to not be working.

## With GO enrichment analysis

* was able to recreate the graphs that Carlos has made
* Now understand the meaning better

* Could make a more focused graph with only the relevant points

## SymPortal

This is a program I have just read about, it takes ITS2 sequences from any algal symbiont and determines which species/genus it belongs to and if there is evidence of multiple symbionts ocupying a single coral

* I have not attemped to use this, but am considering it.
* we may not have the correct data type to use with this program

## The paper

I have focused on writing the methods, I have added citations for each of the programs I have used and collected citations for papers I have looked at. I need some help getting focused on what I should write and how to go about this process.

I have also recolored the graphs so they are all the same color, but we may have to do this again.

Need to keep reading papers and getting a better understanding of how to write a scientific paper that is journal worthy
