# Writing out the discussion so far

## outline

* Easy to see different populations, possibly different species
* how each method was useful or unuseful
    * focs more on how each result connects and shows similar results 

* Symbionts are critical parts to the reef ecosystem 
* Symbionts and Brevolium are still being classified
* How this fits into the broader tree
* If Eunicea flexousa has two species of symbiont present in two seperate populations, could this mean that there are other corals that have sepereated populations that also have multiple symbionts? 
    * how many coral species vs symbiont species identified 
* Brevolium is cited as found in shallow water (Lewis), is the population from deeper water considered deeper than normal? could this be a new finding about brevolium?
