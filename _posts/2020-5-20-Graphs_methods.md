##

Using the tables of Missing info found {add link here} A boxplot was created of all depths showing the outliers 

![Boxplot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Missing_info_boxplot.pdf "Boxplot of all Depths")
Any individule with over .2 missing info was labled

The next box plot only has individules at 10x depth
![Boxplot10x]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Missing_info_boxplot_10x.pdf "Boxplot of 10x")
any individule with over .2 missing info is labled 


Next a bar graph was created that showed the average missing info over all depths of each individule 

![Bargraph]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Missing_info_bargraph.pdf "Bargraph of all Depths")

This Bargraph was made again but only for individules at 10x depth

![Bargraph10x]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Missing_info_bargraph_10x.pdf "Bargraph of 10x")
The individules with over .1 missing info were labeled
