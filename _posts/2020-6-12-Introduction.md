## Outline

* Coral Symbiont Relationships
    * photosynthesis, Depth, and light   
* Population genetics/genomics 
* Past Coral depth studies  
* How Symbionts are being classified more specifically 
    * Phylogenetics
    * PCA
    * SNPs
    * other methods that need background 
* Climate change and conservation efforts 
    * transplanting corals,

## intro Draft

Corals around the world have established an endosymbiotic relationships with dinoflagellates. Corals require the energy produced by the algae through photosynthesis. The symbiotic algae benefits from the relationship by having a constant light source and receiving recycled inorganic nutrients. This endosymbiotic pair are reef builders and provide a home for countless marine species. There are many varieties of corals, the two main groups include hard and soft corals (explination). The knowledge of how many species of coral is well documented, however the symbiont family tree is far from being known.
Until just recently these symbionts were classified under a single genus called Symbiodinium. However, as we further study this symbiont it is more clear how diverse this group of organisms are. The genus Symbiodinium has been split into many genera (Cladocopium, Brevolium, Fugacium, Durusdinium, Greakladium, Effrenium, Symbiodinium) (laJeunesse 2018). The species within these genera are not yet fully established.

The soft coral *Eunicea flexuosa* is commonly associated with the *Brevolium* family of symbiont. *E. flexuosa* is an octocoral from the family Plexauridae. It is a broadcast spawner which allows for transference of symbiont between populations. Brevolium has been shown to be a diverse genus with species spread across the Caribbean (Lewis 2018). as Lewis said these putative species still need further testing.

Here, we use a population genetics approach to determine the genetic difference between populations of Brevolium. Using SNPs we determine the distance between populations genetically.
Using the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) we are also able to study which genes might be responsible for the difference in populations of Brevolium.
Understanding the differences between Brevolium species, and symbiont species in general is becoming increasingly important as conservation efforts try to find possible solutions for coral degradation as ocean temperatures rise. Knowing the symbionts that are best adapted for certain temperatures or depths can help select the best candidates for reseeding of reefs with corals.

Two sentence summary:
Using population genetics to study two potentially different species of Brevolium that are segregated by depth. We are hoping to determine what genes may contribute to the difference between these species and see if it is connected to the light or temperature differences caused by the depth they are found at.
