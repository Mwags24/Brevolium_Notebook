# Focus on the introduction


## Outline

* Coral Symbiont Relationships
    * photosynthesis and light   
* Population genetics 
* Past Coral depth studies  
* How Symbionts are being classified more specifically 
    * Phylogenetics
    * PCA
    * SNPs
    * other methods that need background 
* Climate change and conservation efforts 

* The physical distribution of these symbionts has been studied, but it has not been looked at using SNPs and PCAs



## Draft

Coral around the world have has established an endosymbiotic relationship with dinoflagelates. Until just recently these symbionts were classified under a single genus called symbiodinium. However as we further study this symbiont it is more clear how diverse this group of organisms is. The genus Symbiodinium has been slit into many genuses ( A, Brevolium, C D E). The species within these Genuses are not yet fully established. 

The coral *Eunicea flexoasa* is comonly assosiated with the *Brevolium* family of symbiont. *E. flexousa* is an octocoral from the Caribean.
