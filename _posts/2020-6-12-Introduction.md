# Focus on the introduction


## Outline

* Coral Symbiont Relationships
    * photosynthesis and light   
* Population genetics 
* Past Coral depth studies  
* How Symbionts are being classified more specifically 
    * Phylogenetics
    * PCA
    * SNPs
    * other methods that need background 
* Climate change and conservation efforts 

* The physical distribution of these symbionts has been studied, but it has not been looked at using SNPs and PCAs



## Draft

Coral around the world have has established an endosymbiotic relationship with dinoflagelates.
Until just recently these symbionts were classified under a single genus called symbiodinium. However as we further study this symbiont it is more clear how diverse this group of organisms is. The genus Symbiodinium has been slit into many genuses ( A, Brevolium, C D E). The species within these Genuses are not yet fully established. 

The coral *Eunicea flexuosa* is comonly assosiated with the *Brevolium* family of symbiont. *E. flexuosa* is an octocoral from the family Plexauridae. It is a broadcast spawner which allows for transferance of symbiont between populations. 

Here we use a population genetics approach to determine the genetic difference between populations of Brevolium. Using SNPs we determine the distance between populations genetically. 
Using the SNPs we are also able to study which genes are responsiple for the difference in populations of Brevolium.
Understanding the differences between brevolium species, and symbiont species in general is becoming increasingly immportant as conservation efforts try to find possible solutions for coral degridation as ocean temperatures rise. Knowing the symbionts that are best adapted for certain temperatures or depths can help select the best candidates for reseeding of reefs with corals.
