# testing a third method for fining SNPs under selection


First the file brevolium_snps_biallelic_10x_miss50.recode.vcf was turned into a genepop file



A plot was made of the Fst values
    par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
    plot(fsts$Ht, fsts$Fst,xlab="Ht",ylab="Fst",pch=19)

![Fsthet]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Fsthet.pdf "Fsthet")





file of outliers was created that contained 






compared to pcadapt
